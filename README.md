# Maps-in-R
Different ways of plotting maps using R

This repository will contain maps created in R, I will start by producing some general maps using ggplot2 and also by importing different London statistical GIS boundaries from the Greater London Authoprity website: 

 > Greater London Authority > Satatistical GIS Boundary Files for London

https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london


The different GIS boundaries provide the following level of aggregation for London region maps: 

- Output Area (OA) 2011,

- Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) 2004 and 2011,

- Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) 2004 and 2011,

- London Wards (two files: City of London merged into single area and split into seperate wards). There are separate download file for 2014 & 2018 boundaries.

- London Boroughs
